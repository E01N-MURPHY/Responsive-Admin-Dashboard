A fully responsive website design using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This project has a simple and sleek design showing some basic information that would be useful to an E-Commerce website Admin.

On the left of the page is the menu with buttons to the relevant sections with some sleek and quick animations and styling.
The right side of the page has a toggle for light/dark theme, a greeting message to the user, a section for recent orders, and a section for sales analytics.
