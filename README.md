# **Admin Dashboard**
## **A fully responsive website design using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The objective of this site is to demonstrate my ability and skill with UX/UI** 
### This project has a simple and sleek design showing some basic information that would be useful to an E-Commerce website Admin.

**On the left of the page is the menu with buttons to the relevant sections with some sleek and quick animations and styling.**

**The Center of the page is an overview of Sales, Expenses and Total Income and below that, some recent orders that have been placed showing the product name/number, the status of the payment and order.**

**The right side of the page has a toggle for light/dark theme, a greeting message to the user, a section for recent orders, and a section for sales analytics.**



### **The toggle for light/dark theme is located on the top right of the page**
